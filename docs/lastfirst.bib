  abstract = {Cluster validation is a major issue in cluster analysis. Many existing validity indices do not perform well when clusters overlap or there is significant variation in their covariance structure. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a new validity index for fuzzy clustering. Second, we present a new approach for the objective evaluation of validity indices and clustering algorithms. Our validity index makes use of the covariance structure of clusters, while the evaluation approach utilizes a new concept of overlap rate that gives a formal measure of the difficulty of distinguishing between overlapping clusters. We have carried out experimental studies using data sets containing clusters of different shapes and densities and various overlap rates, in order to show how validity indices behave when clusters become less and less separable. Finally, the effectiveness of the new validity index is also demonstrated on a number of real-life data sets.},

  abstract = {An important goal in cluster analysis is the internal validation of results using an objective criterion. Of particular relevance in this respect is the estimation of the optimum number of clusters capturing the intrinsic structure of your data. This paper proposes a method to determine this optimum number based on the evaluation of fuzzy partition stability under bootstrap resampling. The method is first characterized on synthetic data with respect to hyper-parameters, like the fuzzifier, and spatial clustering parameters, such as feature space dimensionality, clusters degree of overlap, and number of clusters. The method is then validated on experimental datasets. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is compared to that obtained using a number of traditional fuzzy validity rules based on the cluster compactness-to-separation criteria. The proposed method provides accurate and reliable results, and offers better generalization capabilities than the classical approaches.},

  abstract = {The stability of persistence diagrams is among the most important results in applied and computational topology. Most results in the literature phrase stability in terms of the bottleneck distance between diagrams and the \$\textbackslash infty\$-norm of perturbations. This has two main implications: it makes the space of persistence diagrams rather pathological and it is often provides very pessimistic bounds with respect to outliers. In this paper, we provide new stability results with respect to the \$p\$-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. This includes an elementary proof for the setting of functions on sufficiently finite spaces in terms of the \$p\$-norm of the perturbations, along with an algebraic framework for \$p\$-Wasserstein distance which extends the results to wider class of modules. We also provide apply the results to a wide range of applications in topological data analysis (TDA) including topological summaries, persistence transforms and the special but important case of Vietoris-Rips complexes.},
