abstract = {Categorical data fields characterized by a large number of distinct values represent a serious challenge for many classification and regression algorithms that require numerical inputs. On the other hand, these types of data fields are quite common in real-world data mining applications and often contain potentially relevant information that is difficult to represent for modeling purposes. This paper presents a simple preprocessing scheme for high-cardinality categorical data that allows this class of attributes to be used in predictive models such as neural networks, linear and logistic regression. The proposed method is based on a well-established statistical method (empirical Bayes) that is straightforward to implement as an in-database procedure. Furthermore, for categorical attributes with an inherent hierarchical structure, like ZIP codes, the preprocessing scheme can directly leverage the hierarchy by blending statistics at the various levels of aggregation. While the statistical methods discussed in this paper were first introduced in the mid 1950' s, the use of these methods as a preprocessing step for complex models, like neural networks, has not been previously discussed in any literature.},

abstract = {Many high level representations of time series have been proposed for data mining, including Fourier transforms, wavelets, eigenwaves, piecewise polynomial models, etc. Many researchers have also considered symbolic representations of time series, noting that such representations would potentiality allow researchers to avail of the wealth of data structures and algorithms from the text processing and bioinformatics communities. While many symbolic representations of time series have been introduced over the past decades, they all suffer from two fatal flaws. First, the dimensionality of the symbolic representation is the same as the original data, and virtually all data mining algorithms scale poorly with dimensionality. Second, although distance measures can be defined on the symbolic approaches, these distance measures have little correlation with distance measures defined on the original time series. In this work we formulate a new symbolic representation of time series. Our representation is unique in that it allows dimensionality/numerosity reduction, and it also allows distance measures to be defined on the symbolic approach that lower bound corresponding distance measures defined on the original series. As we shall demonstrate, this latter feature is particularly exciting because it allows one to run certain data mining algorithms on the efficiently manipulated symbolic representation, while producing identical results to the algorithms that operate on the original data. In particular, we will demonstrate the utility of our representation on various data mining tasks of clustering, classification, query by content, anomaly detection, motif discovery, and visualization. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Information in the cortex is thought to be represented by the joint activity of neurons. Here we describe how fundamental questions about neural representation can be cast in terms of the topological structure of population activity. A new method, based on the concept of persistent homology, is introduced and applied to the study of population activity in grimary visual cortex (V1). We found that the topological structure of activity patterns when the cortex is spontaneously active is similar to those evoked by natural image stimulation and consistent with the topology of a two sphere. We discuss how this structure could emerge from the functional organization of orientation and spatial frequency maps and their mutual relationship. Our findings extend prior results on the relationship between spontaneous and evoked activity in V1 and illustrates how computational topology can help tackle elementary questions about the representation of information in the nervous system. {\textcopyright} ARVO.},

abstract = {Most algorithms for mining or indexing time series data do not operate directly on the original data, but instead they consider alternative representations that include transforms, quantization, approximation, and multiresolution abstractions. Choosing the best representation and abstraction level for a given task/dataset is arguably the most critical step in time series data mining. In this paper, we investigate techniques to discover the natural intrinsic representation model, dimensionality and alphabet cardinality of a time series. The ability to discover these intrinsic features has implications beyond selecting the best parameters for particular algorithms, as characterizing data in such a manner is useful in its own right and an important sub-routine in algorithms for classification, clustering and outlier discovery. We will frame the discovery of these intrinsic features in the Minimal Description Length (MDL) framework. Extensive empirical tests show that our method is simpler, more general and significantly more accurate than previous methods, and has the important advantage of being essentially parameter-free. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},
