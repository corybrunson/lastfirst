  abstract = {The concept of an {$\alpha$}-shape of a finite set of points in R\^d, with weights, is defined and illustrated. An {$\alpha$}-shape is a polytope which is not necessarily convex nor connected and can be derived from the (weighted) Delaunay triangulation of the point set, with a parameter controlling the desired level of detail. The set of all {$\alpha$} values leads to a descrete family of shapes capturing the intuitive notion of ``crude'' versus ``fine'' shapes of a point set. Software that computes such shapes in R\^2 and R\^3 is available via anonymous ftp from: ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Visualization/Alpha-shape/},

In Cheng, Devillers (eds), 30th Annual Symposium on Computational Geometry, SOCG'14, Kyoto, Japan, June 08\textendash 11, p 328, ACM, 2014). We show that any linear transformation that preserves pairwise distances up to a \$\$(1\textbackslash pm \{\textbackslash varepsilon \})\$\$multiplicative factor, must preserve the persistent homology of the \v{C}ech filtration up to a factor of \$\$(1-\{\textbackslash varepsilon \})\^\{-1\}\$\$. Our results also show that the Vietoris-Rips and Delaunay filtrations for the k-distance, as well as the \v{C}ech filtration for the approximate k-distance of Buchet et al. [J Comput Geom, 58:70\textendash 96, 2016] are preserved up to a \$\$(1\textbackslash pm \{\textbackslash varepsilon \})\$\$factor. We also prove extensions of our main theorem, for point sets (i) lying in a region of bounded Gaussian width or (ii) on a low-dimensional submanifold, obtaining embeddings having the dimension bounds of Lotz (Proc R Soc A Math Phys Eng Sci, 475(2230):20190081, 2019) and Clarkson (Tighter bounds for random projections of manifolds.

  abstract = {Dimension reduction has become inevitable for pre-processing of high dimensional data. ``Gene expression microarray data'' is an instance of such high dimensional data. Gene expression microarray data displays the maximum number of genes (features) simultaneously at a molecular level with a very small number of samples. The copious numbers of genes are usually provided to a learning algorithm for producing a complete characterization of the classification task. However, most of the times the majority of the genes are irrelevant or redundant to the learning task. It will deteriorate the learning accuracy and training speed as well as lead to the problem of overfitting. Thus, dimension reduction of microarray data is a crucial preprocessing step for prediction and classification of disease. Various feature selection and feature extraction techniques have been proposed in the literature to identify the genes, that have direct impact on the various machine learning algorithms for classification and eliminate the remaining ones. This paper describes the taxonomy of dimension reduction methods with their characteristics, evaluation criteria, advantages and disadvantages. It also presents a review of numerous dimension reduction approaches for microarray data, mainly those methods that have been proposed over the past few years.},

Many existing validity indices do not perform well when clusters overlap or there is significant variation in their covariance structure. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we propose a new validity index for fuzzy clustering. Second, we present a new approach for the objective evaluation of validity indices and clustering algorithms. Our validity index makes use of the covariance structure of clusters, while the evaluation approach utilizes a new concept of overlap rate that gives a formal measure of the difficulty of distinguishing between overlapping clusters. We have carried out experimental studies using data sets containing clusters of different shapes and densities and various overlap rates, in order to show how validity indices behave when clusters become less and less separable. Finally, the effectiveness of the new validity index is also demonstrated on a number of real-life data sets.},

Of particular relevance in this respect is the estimation of the optimum number of clusters capturing the intrinsic structure of your data. This paper proposes a method to determine this optimum number based on the evaluation of fuzzy partition stability under bootstrap resampling. The method is first characterized on synthetic data with respect to hyper-parameters, like the fuzzifier, and spatial clustering parameters, such as feature space dimensionality, clusters degree of overlap, and number of clusters. The method is then validated on experimental datasets. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is compared to that obtained using a number of traditional fuzzy validity rules based on the cluster compactness-to-separation criteria. The proposed method provides accurate and reliable results, and offers better generalization capabilities than the classical approaches.},

For example, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) can act as a proapoptotic or prosurvival factor depending on its concentration, the current state of signaling network and the presence of other cytokines. To understand combinatorial regulation in such systems, new computational approaches are required that can take into account non-linear interactions in signaling networks and provide tools for clustering, visualization and predictive modeling.},

The high dimensional data that is generated requires innovative methods for analysis and visualization. We conducted a comparative analysis of four dimension reduction techniques \textendash{} principal component analysis (PCA), isometric feature mapping (Isomap), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and Diffusion Maps by implementing them on benchmark mass cytometry data sets. We compare the results of these reductions using computation time, residual variance, a newly developed comparison metric we term neighborhood proportion error (NPE), and two-dimensional visualizations. We find that t-SNE and Diffusion Maps are the two most effective methods for preserving relationships of interest among cells and providing informative visualizations. In low dimensional embeddings, t-SNE exhibits well-defined phenotypic clustering. Additionally, Diffusion Maps can represent cell differentiation pathways with long projections along each diffusion component. We thus recommend a complementary approach using t-SNE and Diffusion Maps in order to extract diverse and informative cell relationship information in a two-dimensional setting from CyTOF data.},

  abstract = {One primary consideration when developing predictive models is downstream effects on future model performance. We conduct experiments to quantify the effects of experimental design choices, namely cohort selection and internal validation methods, on (estimated) real-world model performance.Four years of hospitalizations are used to develop a 1-year mortality prediction model (composite of death or initiation of hospice care). Two common methods to select appropriate patient visits from their encounter history (backwards-from-outcome and forwards-from-admission) are combined with 2 testing cohorts (random and temporal validation). Two models are trained under otherwise identical conditions, and their performances compared. Operating thresholds are selected in each test set and applied to a ``real-world'' cohort of labeled admissions from another, unused year.Backwards-from-outcome cohort selection retains 25\% of candidate admissions (n\,=\,23~579), whereas forwards-from-admission selection includes many more (n\,=\,92~148). Both selection methods produce similar performances when applied to a random test set. However, when applied to the temporally defined ``real-world'' set, forwards-from-admission yields higher areas under the ROC and precision recall curves (88.3\% and 56.5\% vs. 83.2\% and 41.6\%).A backwards-from-outcome experiment manipulates raw training data, simplifying the experiment. This manipulated data no longer resembles real-world data, resulting in optimistic estimates of test set performance, especially at high precision. In contrast, a forwards-from-admission experiment with a temporally separated test set consistently and conservatively estimates real-world performance.Experimental design choices impose bias upon selected cohorts. A forwards-from-admission experiment, validated temporally, can conservatively estimate real-world performance.The routine care of patients stands to benefit greatly from assistive technologies, including data-driven risk assessment. Already, many different machine learning and artificial intelligence applications are being developed from complex electronic health record data. To overcome challenges that arise from such data, researchers often start with simple experimental approaches to test their work. One key component is how patients (and their healthcare visits) are selected for the study from the pool of all patients seen. Another is how the group of patients used to create the risk estimator differs from the group used to evaluate how well it works. These choices complicate how the experimental setting compares to the real-world application to patients. For example, different selection approaches that depend on each patient's future outcome can simplify the experiment but are impractical upon implementation as these data are unavailable. We show that this kind of ``backwards'' experiment optimistically estimates how well the model performs. Instead, our results advocate for experiments that select patients in a ``forwards'' manner and ``temporal'' validation that approximates training on past data and implementing on future data. More robust results help gauge the clinical utility of recent works and aid decision-making before implementation into practice.},

Since the amount of DR algorithms from which users may choose is steadily increasing, assessing their quality becomes more and more important. We present a novel technique to quantify and compare the quality of DR algorithms that is based on persistent homology. An inherent beneficial property of persistent homology is its robustness against noise which makes it well suited for real world data. Our pipeline informs about the best DR technique for a given data set and chosen metric (e.g. preservation of local distances) and provides knowledge about the local quality of an embedding, thereby helping users understand the shortcomings of the selected DR method. The utility of our method is demonstrated using application data from multiple domains and a variety of commonly used DR methods.},

With this shift toward computerized tools comes a dramatic increase in the amount of available data, and current tools for data analysis capable of extracting meaningful knowledge from this wealth of information have yet to catch up. This article seeks to provide an overview of emerging mathematical methods with the potential to improve the abilities of clinicians and researchers to analyze biomedical data, but may be hindered from doing so by a lack of conceptual accessibility and awareness in the life sciences research community. In particular, we focus on topological data analysis (TDA), a set of methods grounded in the mathematical field of algebraic topology that seeks to describe and harness features related to the ``shape'' of data. We aim to make such techniques more approachable to non-mathematicians by providing a conceptual discussion of their theoretical foundations followed by a survey of their published applications to scientific research. Finally, we discuss the limitations of these methods and suggest potential avenues for future work integrating mathematical tools into clinical care and biomedical informatics.},

In this paper, we provide new stability results with respect to the \$p\$-Wasserstein distance between persistence diagrams. This includes an elementary proof for the setting of functions on sufficiently finite spaces in terms of the \$p\$-norm of the perturbations, along with an algebraic framework for \$p\$-Wasserstein distance which extends the results to wider class of modules.

The goal of these integrated predictors is to combine these varied sources of information, while improving on the predictive ability of any individual modality. A number of application-specific data fusion methods have been previously proposed in the literature which have attempted to reconcile the differences in dimensionalities and length scales across different modalities. Our objective in this paper was to help identify metholodological choices that need to be made in order to build a data fusion technique, as it is not always clear which strategy is optimal for a particular problem. As a comprehensive review of all possible data fusion methods was outside the scope of this paper, we have focused on fusion approaches that employ dimensionality reduction (DR).},

  abstract = {A method is presented for the distributed computation of persistent homology, based on an extension of the generalized Mayer-Vietoris principle to filtered spaces. Cellular cosheaves and spectral sequences are used to compute global persistent homology based on local computations indexed by a scalar field. These techniques permit computation localized not merely by geography, but by other features of data points, such as density. As an example of the latter, the construction is used in the multi-scale analysis of point clouds to detect features of varying sizes that are overlooked by standard persistent homology.},
