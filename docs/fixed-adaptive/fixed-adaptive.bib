abstract = {This paper tackles the problem of computing topological invariants of geometric objects in a robust manner, using only point cloud data sampled from the object. It is now widely recognised that this kind of topological analysis can give qualitative information about data sets which is not readily available by other means. In particular, it can be an aid to visualisation of high dimensional data. Standard simplicial complexes for approximating the topological type of the underlying space (such as Cech, Rips, or a-shape) produce simplicial complexes whose vertex set has the same size as the underlying set of point cloud data. Such constructions are sometimes still tractable, but are wasteful (of computing resources) since the homotopy types of the underlying objects are generally realisable on much smaller vertex sets. We obtain smaller complexes by choosing a set of landmark points from our data set, and then constructing a "witness complex" on this set using ideas motivated by the usual Delaunay complex in Euclidean space. The key idea is that the remaining (non-landmark) data points are used as witnesses to the existence of edges or simplices spanned by combinations of landmark points. Our construction generalises the topology-preserving graphs of Martinetz and Schulten [MS94] in two directions. First, it produces a simplicial complex rather than a graph. Secondly it actually produces a nested family of simplicial complexes, which represent the data at different feature scales, suitable for calculating persistent homology [ELZ00, ZC04]. We find that in addition to the complexes being smaller, they also provide (in a precise sense) a better picture of the homology, with less noise, than the full scale constructions using all the data points. We illustrate the use of these complexes in qualitatively analyzing a data set of 3x3 pixel patches studied by David Mumford et al [LPM03].},

abstract = {Algorithms for persistent homology are well-studied where homomorphisms are induced by inclusion maps. In this paper, we propose a practical algorithm for computing persistence under ℤ2 coefficients for a (monotone) sequence of general simplicial maps and show how these maps arise naturally in some applications of topological data analysis. A simplicial map can be decomposed into a set of elementary inclusions and vertex collapses-two atomic operations that can be supported efficiently with the notion of simplex annotations for computing persistent homology. A consistent annotation through these atomic operations implies the maintenance of a consistent cohomology basis, hence a homology basis by duality. While the idea of maintaining a cohomology basis through an inclusion is not new, maintaining them through a vertex collapse is new, which constitutes an important atomic operation for simulating simplicial maps. Annotations support the vertex collapse in addition to the usual inclusion quite naturally. Finally, we exhibit an application of this new tool in which we approximate the persistence diagram of a filtration of Rips complexes where vertex collapses are used to tame the blow-up in size.

abstract = {Given a continuous function {\$}f:X\backslashto\backslashmathbb{\{}R{\}}{\$} and a cover {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}I{\}}{\$} of its image by intervals, the Mapper is the nerve of a refinement of the pullback cover {\$}f{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}(\backslashmathcal{\{}I{\}}){\$}. Despite its success in applications, little is known about the structure and stability of this construction from a theoretical point of view. As a pixelized version of the Reeb graph of {\$}f{\$}, it is expected to capture a subset of its features (branches, holes), depending on how the interval cover is positioned with respect to the critical values of the function. Its stability should also depend on this positioning. We propose a theoretical framework that relates the structure of the Mapper to the one of the Reeb graph, making it possible to predict which features will be present and which will be absent in the Mapper given the function and the cover, and for each feature, to quantify its degree of (in-)stability. Using this framework, we can derive guarantees on the structure of the Mapper, on its stability, and on its convergence to the Reeb graph as the granularity of the cover {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}I{\}}{\$} goes to zero.},

abstract = {Summarizing topological information from datasets and maps defined on them is a central theme in topological data analysis. Mapper, a tool for such summarization, takes as input both a possibly high dimensional dataset and a map defined on the data, and produces a summary of the data by using a cover of the codomain of the map. This cover, via a pullback operation to the domain, produces a simplicial complex connecting the data points. The resulting view of the data through a cover of the codomain offers flexibility in analyzing the data. However, it offers only a view at a fixed scale at which the cover is constructed. Inspired by the concept, we explore a notion of a tower of covers which induces a tower of simplicial complexes connected by simplicial maps, which we call multiscale mapper. We study the resulting structure, and design practical algorithms to compute its persistence diagrams efficiently. Specifically, when the domain is a simplicial complex and the map is a real-valued piecewise-linear function, the algorithm can compute the exact persistence diagram only from the 1-skeleton of the input complex. For general maps, we present a combinatorial version of the algorithm that acts only on vertex sets connected by the 1-skeleton graph, and this algorithm approximates the exact persistence diagram thanks to a stability result that we show to hold.},

abstract = {Data analysis often concerns not only the space where data come from, but also various types of maps attached to data. In recent years, several related structures have been used to study maps on data, including Reeb spaces, mappers and multiscale mappers. The construction of these structures also relies on the so-called $\backslash$emph{\{}nerve{\}} of a cover of the domain. In this paper, we aim to analyze the topological information encoded in these structures in order to provide better understanding of these structures and facilitate their practical usage. More specifically, we show that the one-dimensional homology of the nerve complex N() of a path-connected cover  of a domain X cannot be richer than that of the domain X itself. Intuitively, this result means that no new H1-homology class can be "created" under a natural map from X to the nerve complex N(). Equipping X with a pseudometric d, we further refine this result and characterize the classes of H1(X) that may survive in the nerve complex using the notion of $\backslash$emph{\{}size{\}} of the covering elements in . These fundamental results about nerve complexes then lead to an analysis of the H1-homology of Reeb spaces, mappers and multiscale mappers. The analysis of H1-homology groups unfortunately does not extend to higher dimensions. Nevertheless, by using a map-induced metric, establishing a Gromov-Hausdorff convergence result between mappers and the domain, and interleaving relevant modules, we can still analyze the persistent homology groups of (multiscale) mappers to establish a connection to Reeb spaces.},

We show that the Mapper is an optimal estimator of the Reeb graph, which gives, as a byproduct, a method to automatically tune its parameters and compute confidence regions on its topological features, such as its loops and flares. This allows to circumvent the issue of testing a large grid of parameters and keeping the most stable ones in the brute-force setting, which is widely used in visualization, clustering and feature selection with the Mapper.},

abstract = {The contributions of this paper are two-fold. We define a new filtration called the cover filtration built from a single cover based on a generalized Jaccard distance. We provide stability results for the cover filtration and show how the construction is equivalent to the Cech filtration under certain settings. We then develop a language and theory for stable paths within this filtration, inspired by ideas of persistent homology. We demonstrate how the filtration and paths can be applied to a variety of applications in which defining a metric is not obvious but a cover is readily available. We demonstrate the usefulness of this construction by employing it in the context of recommendation systems and explainable machine learning. We demonstrate a new perspective for modeling recommendation system data sets that does not require manufacturing a bespoke metric. This extends work on graph-based recommendation systems, allowing a topological perspective. For an explicit example, we look at a movies data set and we find the stable paths identified in our framework represent a sequence of movies constituting a gentle transition and ordering from one genre to another. For explainable machine learning, we apply the Mapper for model induction, providing explanations in the form of paths between subpopulations or observations. Our framework provides an alternative way of building a filtration from a single mapper that is then used to explore stable paths. As a direct illustration, we build a mapper from a supervised machine learning model trained on the FashionMNIST data set. We show that the stable paths in the cover filtration provide improved explanations of relationships between subpopulations of images.},

We show that a variant of this approach yields a filtration that is asymptotically only marginally larger than the tower and can be efficiently computed by a streaming algorithm, both in theory and in practice. Furthermore, we show that our approach can be combined with a streaming algorithm to compute the barcode of the tower via matrix reduction. The space complexity of the algorithm does not depend on the length of the tower, but the maximal size of any subcomplex within the tower. Experimental evaluations show that our approach can efficiently handle towers with billions of complexes.},
