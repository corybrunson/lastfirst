# landmarks

This repo contains code and text files for the ongoing project to extend the conventional distance-based _maxmin_ procedure for generating landmark sets to a complementary rank-based _lastfirst_ procedure. Whereas maxmin can be used to generate _ball covers_ for finite metric spaces, lastfirst yields analogous _neighborhood covers_.

## organization

The repo contains the following root-level directories:

* `docs`: draft manuscripts for conference, poster, preprint, journal, etc. submissions
* `scripts`: executable scripts to generate data, tables, and figures used in manuscripts
